Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python is a software development approach where tests are written before writing the production code. The main idea is to follow an iterative cycle with three steps:

1. **Write a test**: Before writing the functional code, you write a test that describes the functionality you want to implement.
2. **Write the code**: You then write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: After writing the code, you improve and optimize it while ensuring that the tests continue to pass.

This cycle is repeated for each new feature or modification.
