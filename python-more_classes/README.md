### **Class in Python**:
A **class** in Python is a concept that allows you to define a "template" or "blueprint" for creating objects. It's like a generic description of a type of object, specifying what data (attributes) the object will have, and what actions (methods) it can perform.

For example, if we think of a **Car** class, it could define attributes such as color, model, or top speed, as well as actions like start or accelerate.

### **Object in Python**:
An **object** is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, you're creating a specific version of that class with particular values. Each object can have its own data, but it can use the same actions defined in the class.

Let's go back to the Car class example: you could have several objects (cars) based on this class, but each car could have a different color, a different brand, etc.
