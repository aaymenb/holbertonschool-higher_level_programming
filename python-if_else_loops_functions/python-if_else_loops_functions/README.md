Loops in Python are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. They are particularly useful when you need to repeat an action, such as iterating over elements in a list, repeating a task a certain number of times, or waiting for a condition to be met.

There are two main types of loops in Python:

1. **The `for` loop**:  
   - It is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, range of numbers, etc.) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence.
   - You know in advance how many iterations you need to perform (for example, to iterate through all the elements in a list).

2. **The `while` loop**:  
   - It repeats a block of code as long as a given condition remains true.
   - You may not know in advance how many times the loop will run. The loop continues until the condition becomes false.

In addition to these two types of loops, Python provides control mechanisms for managing their execution:
- **`break`**: This statement allows you to exit the loop immediately, regardless of where it is in its execution.
- **`continue`**: It allows you to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
- **`else`**: A loop can be followed by an `else` block, which is executed only if the loop terminates normally (i.e., without being interrupted by `break`).

Loops are essential for repeating actions and can be combined with conditions to create complex flow control structures.
