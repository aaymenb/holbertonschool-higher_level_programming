**APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** enable different systems to communicate and exchange data. They define rules for how applications can interact, whether it's for retrieving or sending information. **RESTful APIs**, for example, use **HTTP/HTTPS** protocols for stateless communication, where each request is independent, ensuring better scalability and performance. APIs are essential for integrating services in interconnected environments.
